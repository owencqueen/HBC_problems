# Honors-by-Contract Problems
Problems from MATH 423 (Probability) and 425 (Statistics) completed as part of my Honors-by-Contract at the University of Tennessee. I wrote all of these problems in LaTex myself, but I have not included that code here. Note that some of the problems were not proofs that I wrote myself, I simply copied them for understanding. I have indicated in the lists below which ones are of my original work and which ones were copied from the following source:

R. J. Larsen and M. L. Marx, *An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications*, 5th ed. Boston, MA: Prentice Hall, 2012.

All of the problems came from either Larsen and Marx or from Dr. Balram Rajput, my instructor for both courses.

## 423 Problems
All problems for MATH 423 (Probability) are located in the *MATH_423* repository.
1. **CLT_proof.pdf**
- Copied from Larsen and Marx.
2. **HW3_HBC.pdf**
- Question 1 is my original work and Question 2 is copied from Larsen and Marx.
3. **HW4_HBC.pdf**
- Both Example 3.8.2 and Theorem 3.8.4 were copied from Larsen and Marx.
4. **HW5_HBC.pdf**
- Both examples were copied from Larsen and Marx.
5. **Law_of_Large_Numbers_Proof.pdf**
- Copied from Larsen and Marx.

## 425 Problems
